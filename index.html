<!--
These files represent a typical HTML5 and up to date web site. When a user visits the website, it loads index.html.
Index.html then loads the files it needs, including custom.js. Custom.js will talk to info.php via an Asynchronous
Javascript And XML (AJAX) call, and info.php will return the data back from the database. Custom.js then changes
index.html to show the data that was loaded. You can think of these three files as a general example of
Model-View-Controller (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), which is a common way of
structuring an application. Index.html would be the view, custom.js would be the controller, and info.php would be the
model. An additional file, Fake.php, has been included to allow for easy population of the database with fake data.
NOTE: FAKE.PHP WILL ERASE YOUR TABLE BEFORE REPOPULATING IT!

        These stylesheets are for a CSS framework called Twitter Bootstrap. As you can see, I'm referencing them from
        another web site; web sites that provide files for the public to use are called Content Delivery Networks (CDN).
        CDNs are helpful because they allow you to use someone else's bandwidth to load styling and Javascript.
        Additionally, CDNs are helpful because if the CDN is a big company (like Google or in the case below, Microsoft),
        chances are that your visitor has a cached version of this file from visiting that company's web site. This results
        in a FASTER load time for your visitor as they visit YOUR web site. Obviously, the disadvantages of CDNs lie
        in the fact that they're remote: you have no control over what file they place at that location nor do you have
        a guarantee that the file will exist at that location later today. Best to choose trusted CDNs and make sure to
        keep your web site up to date.

        Now I'm loading more stuff from the CDNs (I'm using both the Microsoft CDN and the Google CDN here). I'm loading
        a Javascript library called jQuery which is very popular among web developers. It makes doing Javascript stuff
        much easier. You can see some jQuery code in the custom.js file which I also load here.
